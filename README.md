# 7 Days of Code - Challenge

Building a realistic project.

In this project I tried to code the fastest as I could to test my time control and to see how I would do if I had a deadline to finish the project.

Another thing that I tried to do was to make my HTML cleaner than the latest projects that I made!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5;
- CSS custom properties;
